# Decentralized Governance

The Syscoin protocol provides the Syscoin community the means to participate in decentralized governance. Very similar to the governance of Dash, Syscoin enables owners of Sentry Nodes with the option cast votes on proposals that are seeking funding from a monthly superblock emission. Proposals can be submitted by anyone.

Check back for more details and a detailed walkthrough!  Until then, suffice to say, the details and process of participating is practically identical to that of Dash governance.

Sysnode.info provides a very useful [governance dashboard](https://sysnode.info/governance) that makes it easier to participate in Syscoin governance.
