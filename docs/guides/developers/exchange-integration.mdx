# SPT Exchange Integration



**This guide is a primer to help exchanges integrate Syscoin Platform Tokens (SPT's).**

The Syscoin platform provides a UTXO-based token issuance system embedded in the Syscoin blockchain. Transactions of SPT's consume network fees paid in SYS and can provide token recipients an accompanying default "pass-forward" amount of SYS dust to enable them to transact the SPT without having to acquire or own SYS beforehand.

An SPT has several noteworthy properties. Most important is the `asset_guid`, the deterministically-assigned unique identifier of the token on the Syscoin blockchain. Similar to Ethereum, anyone can create a token and make its symbol "AGX" but there can only ever be one official AGX token with the `asset_guid` of 367794646. Several popular SPT's and their associated identifiers can be found in the table below.

| SPT Symbol | SPT Description                     | SPT Asset Guid | Website |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------- | :------ |
| AGX        | AGX Silver Token                    | 367794646      |         |
| AUX        | Official Interfix Gold backed Token | 1358717298     |         |
| BTZC       | BeatzCoin SPT                       | 315501466      |         |

There are two paths for integrating SPT assets.

- Interact with a syscoin daemon (syscoind) instance directly via RPC (you can optionally use [syscoin-js](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin-js) for this)
- Interact with Syscoin via a Web 3.0 approach by using [syscoinjs-lib](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoinjs-lib) which interacts with a running [Syscoin Blockbook](https://github.com/syscoin/blockbook) instance or a gateway of load-balanced Blockbook instances.

## Set up for Interacting with Syscoin Directly via RPC

This walk-through assumes you are using the OS console.

1. Ensure the following line is in your syscoin.conf (default path `~/.syscoin/syscoin.conf`)

```text
assetindex=1
```

1. Launch syscoind

> ### ðŸ“˜Reindexing to build local asset index
>
> If you previously launched syscoind without `assetindex=1` in syscoin.conf, use -reindex, e.g. `syscoind -reindex`

```text
$ syscoind
```

1. Create a wallet

> ### ðŸ“˜Note
>
> We strongly suggest creating two separate wallets, one strictly for SYS, and the other for SPT's with a smaller amount of SYS for transaction fees. This eliminates confusion and headaches related to coin control with SPT's.

```text
$ syscoin-cli createwallet "walletname"
```

From here on, all syscoin-cli calls will need to add the `-rpcwallet "walletname"` argument.
If using http-rpc, the https url should be in the form of `http://[ip]:[port]/wallet/[walletname]`

You can also launch syscoind in a way that connects with a specific wallet by using the `-wallet` argument with the path to the directory containing the wallet.dat file.

## Commonly Used RPC Functions for Exchange Integration

For RPC documentation, please see https://syscoincore.org/en/doc/4.2.0/

You can also use use `help <command>` for a full description of the RPC and its options and arguments

| Function                                           | SYS                                 | SPT                                      |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Query address balances                             | `addressbalance`                    | `assetallocationbalance`                 |
| Obtain the block height or other chain status info | `getblockchaininfo`                 | `getblockchaininfo`                      |
| Obtain wallet transaction list                     | `listtransactions` or `listunspent` | `listtransactions` or `listunspentasset` |
| Get transaction details                            | `gettransaction`                    | `gettransaction`                         |
| Asset transfer                                     | `sendtoaddress`                     | `assetallocationsend`                    |
| Asset transfer (batch)                             | `sendmany`                          | `assetallocationsendmany`                |

**Query asset balances**
`assetallocationbalance <assetGUID> "[\"<address>\"]" <minimum#ofConfirmations (optional)>`

You can query the sum balance of multiple addresses by listing more than one address, e.g.:
`assetallocationbalance <assetGUID> "[\"<address>\",\"<address>\"]" <minimum#ofConfirmations (optional)>`

Output:
"amount": SYS gas balance supplied for this asset
"asset_amount": SPT balance

```text
$ syscoin-cli assetallocationbalance 530240372620954 "[\"tsys1qedy7ukgnj9e96axgarw79e2au98ff9g4ffh829\"]" 10

{
  "amount": 0.00001960,
  "asset_amount": 3.55000000
}
```

**Obtain the blockheight or other chain status info**

```text
$ syscoin-cli getblockchaininfo

**Obtain wallet transaction list for assets**
`listtransactions` is general purpose. It covers all transaction types and its output is verbose.
`listunspentasset <assetGuid> <minimum#ofConfirmations (optional)>` is more specific.

```text
$ syscoin-cli listunspentasset 530240372620954 10
[
  {
    "txid": "ac74df7b065bf501db991153920db3462780c8d238ef6fc5562ee7e4b2db565d",

]
```

**Get transaction details**

```text
$ syscoin-cli gettransaction fa4ee19861d5f9c0aa46d20f332458e559921255cf98c0873afc2462849588ba
```

## Setup for using Blockbook API and syscoinjs-lib

Syscoin Blockbook uses its own syscoind instance as the backend, and indexes the blockchain data and tracks XPUB-based account balances to serve the API.

Please follow the readme in https://www.github.com/syscoin/blockbook if you want to implement your own Blockbook server instance.
syscoinjs-lib is used to communicate with blockbook server and the documentation is located at https://www.github.com/syscoin/syscoinjs-lib

Examples for using syscoinjs-lib are located at https://www.github.com/syscoin/syscoinjs-lib-examples

A public Blockbook server instance for Syscoin is located at [https://sys1.bcfn.ca](https://sys1.bcfn.ca/)
