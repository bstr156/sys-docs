### Rollux Testnet Details

The testnet uses test SYS (TSYS), which has no value and is used for testing code before deploying it on mainnet. There is no need to add this network if you don't want to test anything.

- **Network Name:** Rollux Testnet
- **RPC URL:** [https://rpc-tanenbaum.rollux.com](https://rpc-tanenbaum.rollux.com)
- **Chain ID:** 57000
- **Currency Symbol:** TSYS
- **Block Explorer URL:** [https://rollux.tanenbaum.io/](https://rollux.tanenbaum.io/)



Once this information has been entered click **Save**.

You have now connected to the Syscoin Rollux Testnet with your Metamask Wallet!

> **Transactions on the Rollux testnet require TSYS (Test SYS) which is used for gas.**


### How to get TSYS and/or bridge TSYS to Rollux

TSYS (test SYS) can be bridged to the Rollux network. If you do not own any TSYS, first you will need to get some from the following faucet in order to use the bridge:

- https://faucet.tanenbaum.io/

(if you need more TSYS than the faucet provides, please reach-out to your Syscoin contact(s) or ask in Discord)

Now you need to send your TSYS to Rollux where it will show up at the same address.

To do this, switch to the Syscoin Tanenbaum Testnet network in MetaMask.

> **If you need to add the Syscoin Tanenbaum Testnet (L1) to MetaMask, [go here](https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/guides/nevm/metamask/) for instructions**

Simply send TSYS to the following smart contract address on Tanenbaum:
**0x6aa4fEb8078661d0fce3E41C0D783f369B42Ae06**
 
Once your transfer receives a confirmation on Tanenbaum, your TSYS will be on Rollux at your same address. 

Now switch your network to Rollux in MetaMask to see your TSYS balance and begin using the network.
