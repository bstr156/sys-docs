# Add to MetaMask

You can add the Syscoin Rollux networks to MetaMask using the table below. Welcome to Rollux!

| Network                                    |                                                      |
| :----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Syscoin Rollux Testnet                             | <AddNetworkComponent network={'Rollux Optimistic Testnet'}/>           |

Once you're connected
1. **[Get some TSYS](/docs/guides/rollux/metamask#how-to-get-tsys)** (test SYS) on Rollux or bridge L1 TSYS to Rollux
2. Try **[Pegasys DEX](https://rollux.pegasys.finance)** on the Rollux testnet!

### Rollux Testnet Details

The testnet uses test SYS (TSYS), which has no value and is used for testing code before deploying it on mainnet. There is no need to add this network if you don't want to test anything.

- **Network Name:** Rollux Testnet
- **RPC:** [https://rpc-tanenbaum.rollux.com](https://rpc-tanenbaum.rollux.com)
- **Chain ID:** 57000
- **Currency Symbol:** TSYS
- **Block Explorer:** [https://rollux.tanenbaum.io/](https://rollux.tanenbaum.io/)



Once this information has been entered click **Save**.

You have now connected to the Syscoin Rollux Testnet with your Metamask Wallet!

> **Transactions on the Rollux testnet require TSYS (Test SYS) which is used for gas.**


### How to get TSYS

If you do not own any TSYS, you have a couple of options.

1. Use the **[Tanenbaum Authenticated Faucet](https://faucet.tanenbaum.io/)** which provides TSYS on the Tanenbaum (testnet) L1, then use the Rollux Portal (described further down) to transfer it to Rollux.  

2. Request some Rollux TSYS in the official Syscoin Discord. This TSYS already exists on Rollux, making things even easier for you. Just jump in and say “Please send me some Rollux TestSYS.”, and provide your Rollux address. Someone will respond shortly.


### Rollux Portal (bridge dapp)

Makes it easy to transfer assets from the NEVM Tanenbaum L1 to Rollux. This is a native lock/mint bridge.  
To use it, go to **[https://bridge-testnet.syscoin.org/](https://bridge-testnet.syscoin.org/)** and click button `Rollux Portal`.
