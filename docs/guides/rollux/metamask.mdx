Looking for simple instructions to connect to Rollux? Head to the **[Rollux Help Center](https://sys-labs.github.io/community-hub/docs/help/)**!

Once you're connected you can...

-  Move your SYS to Rollux using the [Rollux Portal](https://bridge.rollux.com), Rollux's canonical bridge.
-  Use a Rollux [faucet](https://rollux.id/faucet?chainId=570) to get a small amount of SYS to cover a fee or two on Rollux.
-  Get going with some dapps on Rollux such as [Pegasys](https://app.pegasys.fi) DEX, [Luxy](https://luxy.io) NFT Marketplace, or any other live dapps in the [Rollux ecosystem](https://rollux.com/ecosystem)!
