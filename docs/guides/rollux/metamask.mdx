### Rollux OPv1 Testnet Details

The testnet uses test Rollux SYS (rSYS), which has no value and is used for testing code before deploying it on mainnet. There is no need to add this network if you don't want to test anything.

- **Network Name:** Rollux OPv1 Testnet
- **New RPC URL:** [https://testnet.rollux.com:2814](https://testnet.rollux.com:2814/)
- **Chain ID:** 2814
- **Currency Symbol:** rSYS
- **Block Explorer URL:** [https://explorer.testnet.rollux.com](https://explorer.testnet.rollux.co/)



Once this information has been entered click **Save**.

You have now connected to Rollux OPv1 Testnet with your Metamask Wallet!

> **Transactions on Rollux OPv1 Testnet require Test RSYS which is used for gas.**


### How to get RSYS

Test RSYS can be acquired by bridging TSYS (test SYS) to the Rollux network. Get some TSYS from the following faucet in order to use the bridge:

- https://faucet.tanenbaum.io/

(if you need more TSYS than the faucet provides, please reach-out to your Syscoin contact(s) or ask in Discord)

Now you need to bridge your TSYS to Rollux where it will show up as RSYS at your same address.

To do this, you need to switch to the Syscoin Tanenbaum Testnet network in MetaMask.

> **If you need to add the Syscoin Tanenbaum Testnet to MetaMask, [go here](https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/guides/nevm/metamask/) for instructions**

Simply send TSYS to the following smart contract address on Tanenbaum:
**0x35141FB96fbC6A8F9D5D239b5a6256F056634672**
 
As soon as your transfer receives a confirmation on Tanenbaum, your RSYS will arrive at your same address on the Rollux network.

Now switch your network to Rollux OPv1 Testnet in MetaMask to see your RSYS balance and begin using the network.
