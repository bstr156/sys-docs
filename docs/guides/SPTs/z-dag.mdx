# Z-DAG Developer Guide

Z-DAG is a patent-pending transaction technology implemented on the Syscoin blockchain that enables near-instant, low-cost transactions that are highly scalable. Z-DAGs transactional throughput has been audited by third party blockchain auditing firm [Whiteblock](https://whiteblock.io/), you can [view their report here](https://syscoin.org/whitepaper#tps). For more technical information on Z-DAG refer to the [Z-DAG Syscoin Community page](https://syscoin.community/features/z-dag) or the [Syscoin Z-DAG Whitepaper](https://syscoin.org/zdag_syscoin_whitepaper.pdf).

## Z-DAG Basics

Z-DAG is an interactive protocol, meaning you can continue to check the Z-DAG status all the way up to the point of blockchain confirmation. In today's network conditions a minimum Z-DAG threshold of 10 seconds or later are typically secure (99.9999%). Within certain enterprise deployments lower Z-DAG thresholds can be considered secure dependent on network conditions.

A typical transaction workflow has 2 stages:

1. The transaction enters the mempool (unconfirmed).
2. The transaction is mined into a block (confirmed).

When using Z-DAG, there are 3 stages:

1. The transaction enters the mempool (unconfirmed).
2. After a predefined Z-DAG threshold time the interactive protocol is called and returns a Z-DAG status.
3. The transaction is mined into a block (confirmed).

When step 2 returns a Z-DAG status of 0 (after the Z-DAG threshold) that means the SPT can be re-spent without the risk of double-spends. Longer Z-DAG thresholds provide a higher level of security. When transactions are in a Z-DAG state available balance for re-spending should be determined using the Z-DAG balance.

## Understanding Z-DAG Statuses

Z-DAG status is retrieved by the command `assetallocationverifyzdag`. The output will reflect one of the following status levels:

| Status | Description                                                  |
| :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| -1     | NOT FOUND (transaction is already confirmed on-chain, or is not a Z-DAG transaction) |
| 0      | OK                                                           |
| 1      | WARNING (there are more spending balances than the current POW sender balance in the mempool. An active stance should be taken and perhaps a deeper analysis as to potential conflicts related to the sender.) |
| 2      | CRITICAL (an active double spend was detected. Any descendant asset allocations are flagged as dangerous and should wait for POW confirmation before proceeding.) |

## Using Z-DAG Balances

The available balance while use Z-DAG can be determined by calling `assetallocationbalance`. If `balance` and `zdag_balance` are the same, then display `balance`. If the balances differ that is an indication that Z-DAG is active for this transaction and it has not yet been confirmed by Proof of Work. In this scenario the `zdag_balance` should be used to indicate to the user their available balance.
