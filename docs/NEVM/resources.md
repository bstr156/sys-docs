# Developer Resources



This page contains resources that will help facilitate developers building on Syscoin's NEVM. As it is forked from Ethereum the development process is essentially the same for writing, deploying and testing smart contracts and utilizing them through dApps. As such the following resources will not be an exhaustive list but will be a list of resources that are some of the favorites used by solidity smart contract/dApp developers.



## Tooling

**Truffle Suite**:

- **[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)**- A world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.
- **[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)** - A personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is available as both a desktop application as well as a command-line tool (formerly known as the TestRPC). Ganache is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **[Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle)** - A collection of front-end libraries that make writing dapp front-ends easier and more predictable. The core of Drizzle is based on a Redux store, so you have access to the spectacular development tools around Redux. We take care of synchronizing your contract data, transaction data and more.



**Hardhat**

A more recently released development environment that has similarities to Truffle, it provides the ability to compile, deploy, test and debug solidity smart contracts. [Find out more here.](https://hardhat.org/)



**Remix IDE**

This is an in-browser IDE that enables the writing, deploying and testing of smart contracts. It gives developers the ability to connect to any network they like through the use of browser extensions like MetaMask. [Find out more here.](https://remix.ethereum.org/)



## Documentation

**Solidity Documentation**

This is the programming language used to write smart contracts on EVM-based blockchains. [Find out more here.](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)



## ZkRollups

As Syscoin is primarily focused on the adoption of zkRollups, and using the Syscoin blockchain as the settlement layer for them, here are relevant links to further information on getting involved in the different zkRollup communities.

- **[StarkWare](https://starkware.co/)** - a layer 2 network that uses zkSTARK proofs and the Cairo programming language.

- **[zkSync](https://zksync.io/)** - an open-source scaling and privacy engine, which uses zkSNARK proofs.

- **[Aztec](https://aztec.network/)** - an open-source, layer 2 network that utilizes zkSNARK proofs, PLONK technology and the Noir programming language.

  

- ## Communities

**CryptoDevs Discord**

This is a Discord server that is centred around cryptocurrency development and is a great place to find like-minded developers who are also into developing or learning about web3. [Join the server here.](https://discord.com/invite/5W5tVb3)
