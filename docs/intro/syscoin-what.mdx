# About Syscoin

## What is Syscoin?

Syscoin is a Proof-of-Work blockchain, [merged-mined](../tech/masternodes) with Bitcoin. At its base it is a dual-layered blockchain: the core is the Syscoin blockchain itself, and running in tandem with it is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer called [*NEVM*](../tech/nevm) (Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine), which provides smart contract functionality.



Notable features of Syscoin include:

- [*NEVM*](../tech/nevm) - the Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine that powers Syscoin's smart contract layer.

- [*Z-DAG*](../tech/z-dag) - an instant settlement protocol used to enable blisteringly fast Syscoin Platform Token (SPT) transfers.
- [*Masternodes*](../tech/masternodes) - incentivized full nodes which utilize [*ChainLock*](../tech/chainlocks) technology to come to a consensus on the next block mined in the blockchain and are paid to provide services to the network such as facilitating Z-DAG transactions.
- [*Notary rulesets*](../tech/notary) - in a nutshell these allow [*Syscoin Platform Token (SPT)*](../tech/tokens) creators to apply their own rulesets on transfers of their SPT and then accept or deny the transfers by signing or not signing the transactions. These off-chain rulesets enable SPT creators to maintain regulatory compliance even when regulations change.
