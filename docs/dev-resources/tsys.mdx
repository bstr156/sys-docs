After connecting to the Syscoin Mainnet or Tanenbaum Testnet with MetaMask ([tutorial here](../guides/nevm/metamask)), head to either one of the below to get some SYS or tSYS as you require, this guide assumes tSYS but applies to Mainnet (SYS) as well:

- https://faucet.syscoin.org (Mainnet)
- https://faucet.tanenbaum.io (Testnet)



Copy your address from MetaMask.

Your MetaMask Wallet will now be funded with SYS/tSYS and you can now interact with dApps on Syscoin NEVM.



## Syscoin Testnet Chain

In order to access the Syscoin testnet faucet you must first join the [Syscoin Discord server](https://discord.gg/syscoin).

After doing this, navigate to the #tsys-faucet channel, under the DEVELOPMENT heading.

Then use the command:

`!sendme amount address`

Where the amount is the amount of tSYS you would like to be sent (maximum 100k at a time), and the address is the Syscoin testnet address you would like the funds sent to.
