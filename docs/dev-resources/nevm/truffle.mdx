# Deploying Smart Contracts with Truffle



This is a guide to creating and deploying smart contracts with Truffle on the Syscoin Tanenbaum Testnet.

*NOTE: Syscoin is designed to be a settlement layer for zkRollups and other L2s/execution layers, as such it has a 2.5 minute block time for the optimal settlement security, it is advised to create dApps using zkRollups rather than using the Syscoin blockchain itself for executing smart contracts. You can find zkRollup resources [here](zk-rollups).*

This guide assumes that you have already:

- Installed [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on your system 

- Imported the [Tanenbaum Testnet (or Mainnet) network into MetaMask](../../guides/nevm/metamask)

- Requested gas from either the [Tanenbaum faucet or Mainnet faucet](../tsys)

  

## 1. Install Truffle and create a project

To install Truffle use the following command:

```
npm install truffle -g
```

Make a new directory where you wish to create your project then `cd` into it and run the command below:

```
truffle init
```

Then enter this command to install support for HD wallet providers:

```
npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider -s
```

## 2. Create a new contract

Create a new file in the `contracts` directory called `HelloNEVM.sol`.

Paste the following code into the `HelloNEVM.sol` file.

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.10;

contract HelloNEVM {
    function sayHello() public pure returns(string memory) {
        return('Hello NEVM!');
    }
}
```



## 3. Configure the network used by Truffle

In `truffle-config.js` in the `networks:{}` section, add the following:

```js
mainnet: {
    provider: function() {
        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rpc.syscoin.org")
    },
    websocket: true,        // Enable EventEmitter interface for web3 (default: false)
    network_id: 57,
    gas: 8000000      // gas should be no higher than 8m   
}
tanenbaum: {
    provider: function() {
        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rpc.tanenbaum.io/")
    },
    websocket: true,        // Enable EventEmitter interface for web3 (default: false)
    network_id: 5700,
    gas: 8000000      // gas should be no higher than 8m
}
```

Then create a new file in the same directory called `.secret	` and store your mnemonic from MetaMask in there and uncomment the line in `truffle-config.js` where `mnemonic` is initialized. Don't forget to add an entry in `.gitignore` for the `.secret` file.

## 4. Deploy the contract

In the `migrations` folder create a JavaScript file named `2_deploy_contracts.js` for deploying the contract.

Paste the following code into the file.

```js
var HelloNEVM = artifacts.require('HelloNEVM');
module.exports = function(deployer) {
    deployer.deploy(HelloNEVM, 'Hello NEVM!');
    // Additional contracts can be deployed here
};
```

Once this has been done then you can then deploy the contract (use `mainnet` if you want to deploy on mainnet rather than the Tanenbaum testnet).

```
truffle deploy --network tanenbaum
```

You will then receive something similar to the following output showing that the contracts have been successfully deployed.

Congratulations! Your contracts have been deployed and in the `Deploying 'HelloNEVM'` section you can see the contract's address, which is worth saving if you wish to interact with it at a later date.

## 5. Interact with the smart contract

`cd` to the root of your project directory then use this command to use Truffle on the Tanenbaum network (as specified in the `truffle-config.js`)

```
truffle console --network tanenbaum
```

You can then call the `sayHello()` function with the following input:

```
HelloNEVM.deployed().then(function(instance){return instance.sayHello()});
```
