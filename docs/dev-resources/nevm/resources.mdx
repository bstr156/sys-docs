# Resources



This page contains resources that will help facilitate developers building on Syscoin's NEVM. As it is forked from Ethereum the development process is essentially the same for writing, deploying and testing smart contracts and utilizing them through dApps. As such the following resources will not be an exhaustive list but will be a list of resources that are some of the favorites used by solidity smart contract/dApp developers.



- [Documentation and Libraries](/docs/dev-resources/nevm/docs-and-libs)
- [Courses, Guides and Tutorials](/docs/dev-resources/nevm/guides-and-tuts)

- [Tooling](/docs/dev-resources/nevm/tooling)

- [ZK-Rollups](/docs/dev-resources/nevm/zk-rollups)
