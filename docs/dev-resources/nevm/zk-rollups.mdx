  - You can find a large number of StarkNet (StarkWare's main ZK-Rollup solution) resources [here](https://github.com/gakonst/awesome-starknet).
- **[zkSync](https://zksync.io/)** - an open-source scaling and privacy engine, which uses zkSNARK proofs.
- **[Aztec](https://aztec.network/)** - an open-source, layer 2 network that utilizes zkSNARK proofs, PLONK technology and the Noir programming language. Aztec is largely focused on private payments solutions.
