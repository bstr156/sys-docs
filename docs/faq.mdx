# FAQ



## Is Syscoin Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS)?



## What is Syscoin's max supply?

With the release of NEVM Syscoin now no longer has a maximum supply, as [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) has been adopted any gas fees from smart contracts will be burned.

## How do I transfer SYS to the NEVM chain for using smart contracts?



## What is Syscoin's block time?

Syscoin's block time is 2.5 minutes, this is slow in comparison to other smart chains but has been set at this duration to ensure the highest security of the chain. The [ChainLock](tech/chainlocks) technology Syscoin uses to further secure its blockchain, beyond the Bitcoin merged-mining, works optimally at this block time, and as Syscoin aims to be a secure settlement layer for [zkRollups](https://cryptobriefing.com/zk-rollups-path-scaling-ethereum/) developers are expected to be running dApps not on the main chain but on zkRollups. As such, users will only experience the 2.5 minute block time when transferring on the main chain and will have near-instant transactions while transacting or using DeFi on zkRollups.

## How secure is Syscoin?

Syscoin is merged-mined with Bitcoin, what this means is that the miners mining Bitcoin can mine Syscoin at the same time, with no extra power required. At time of writing Syscoin has around 20% of Bitcoin's hashrate (mining power). The Syscoin hashrate can be seen [here](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/syscoin/hashrate-chart). We are looking to onboard more miners for even more security. Besides having 20% of Bitcoin's hashrate Syscoin also has [ChainLocks](/tech/chainlocks), which help to secure the chain even further by preventing selfish mining.
