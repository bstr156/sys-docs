# Syscoin Platform Tokens (SPTs)



Syscoin Platform Tokens, or SPTs for short, are tokens that reside on the Syscoin blockchain, rather than the NEVM blockchain that runs alongside it and supports ERC-20 tokens. SPTs are UTXO-based tokens (so transactions operate like Bitcoin transactions), rather than account-based (like Ethereum), this offers greater efficiency and allows SPTs to support any current or new innovations that are made available on Bitcoin, such as Lightning Network or Taproot. SPTs can also take advantage of Syscoin's [Z-DAG](z-dag) technology, for blisteringly fast token payments.



Another useful aspect of SPTs is the possibility to create Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These are very lightweight; compared to a standard token they use only 4 extra bytes on the blockchain. If you are interested in checking them out you can download [Pali Wallet](https://paliwallet.com/), a browser extension wallet that supports Syscoin and SPTs, and mint some NFTs on [SysMint](https://sysmint.paliwallet.com/).
